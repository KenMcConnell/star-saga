# ARMON VANCE

Armon Vance's rookie deep space assignment came as First Officer of the oldest Corvette in the fleet, the Weippe. When I first came up with his character, I knew I needed someone vaguely middle eastern, good looking and in his late twenties. I settled on this image of actor William Levy to cast him in my mind's eye.

As the Starship Series progresses, Vance ages. By the time he's into the middle trilogy, he's in his late thirties, early forties and at the time of the final trilogy, he's in his late fifties early sixties. Which, by no small coincidence is the age of his captain in Corvette, Book One.
