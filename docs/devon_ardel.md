# DEVON ARDEL

When I first came up with the character of Devon Ardel, I imagined that she would look exactly like Starbuck from the new Battlestar Galactica TV series. Then that show came out and I was stuck with the image, so really, any blonde woman with a rough side would work. Recently I imagined the actress Elysa Cuthbert as being somewhat like Devon. Primarily because she had a sullen side that I thought worked with Devon's character. <img src="../battlestar-galactica-3.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" align="right"/>

Devon Ardel was my cowboy hero for the western landscape that was Ocherva. A loner, tough as nails and one hell of a good pilot. Able to take a hit from any man and smarter than anyone trying to hit her. In the short stories where she's a Stellar Ranger, she gets banged up pretty good. She was not afraid of having scars and wore them with pride.
