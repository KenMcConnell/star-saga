It blasted right past Starstrikers into its own orbit. I made serious money on that little book, and it did exactly what I had hoped it would do, bring in fans to the Star Saga. Readers really responded to the hero of Corvette, a young Commander named Armon Vance. The overwhelming response to that book was where is the next Vance story? Again, I had been caught flat footed with no sequel ready. So I stopped what I was writing at the time and cranked out a second book and then a third. But while I was working on the second book of the Starship Series, I realized how I could end the series. I could bring Vance's story right up to the front door of Starforgers where readers could carry on with the Star Saga. How many novellas would it take to get me there? Nine. Of course. The Starship Series takes place over the career of Armon Vance. The Corvette trilogy shows him becoming a Captain and chasing after the woman whom he had fallen for and then left him to become the mate of a legendary pirate. Each trilogy in this series would be separated by roughly ten years and would end with him joining a group of civilian explorers. At the time of this writing, I am working on editing the middle trilogy and writing the final trilogy of that series. Here is the algorithm for each \"trilogy\": Short Story Anthology Vol 1 - Featuring the early days of main character from the novels. Short Story Anthology Vol 2 - May or may not happen for each trilogy. First Novel - Introduction of the new set of characters and their mission. First Novella - Focusing on one of the main characters with a side adventure. Second Novel - Middle book where bad things happen to the main characters. Second novella - Another side quest, possibly featuring the villains. Third Novel - The final novel where the trilogy wraps up. I expect to get back to the Star Saga sometime in 2022. That original nine book series has now grown into a set of five book trilogies with a nine book lead in series. I'm tired just thinking about all the writing I have to do before I die. Over the years I have been developing a single universe and have written over a dozen books in it. I'm not tired of it yet. I love every story I tell in the Star Saga Universe. I hope readers will stick with me until it's complete. I hope I live that long.","title":"Another damn series"},{"location":"another-damn-series/#another-damn-series","text":"Corvette was published with little fanfare and quickly shot up the sales charts on Amazon like no other book in my inventory had since Starstrikers.

We had been messing around with my father's 8mm home movie camera and coming up with cool short story ideas that mirrored what we saw happening in the Star Wars films. From those early films and short stores came the idea to make a Sci-Fi novel that was more Wars than magical Force from Star Wars. We were all fans of war movies and wanted to make a story that was more Military SF than Space Fantasy. What we came up with was a Special Forces in space trope with clearly established good and bad sides and lots of interstellar starship fighting. The resulting story was called Galaxy Collision and we made models of many of the ships and hardware that we dreamed up while listening to John Williams soundtracks. The story had three main stars, each character based on one of us. I was a nascent writer and knew very little about fiction and how it was supposed to be done. I took a tone that could best be described as a Walter Lord meets Robert Clive Cussler semi-documentary style of prose. I had scribbled many chapters into school notebooks, but never managed to finalize the story. It was alive in my head though and I spent the better part of my salad days thinking about the story. While in Film School, I wrote half of the story as a screenplay. My writing teacher butchered the script, but liked the where I was going with it. Years later, while stationed in the desert as a part of Operation Northern Watch, I decided to write it as a novel. The story only existed in some hand written notes, drawings and inside my head. I didn't even have an outline. Probably didn't know that would have helped. I didn't fancy myself as a writer. Had no dream to win a Hugo or get rich and famous from it. I only wanted to tell the story my childhood friends and I had come up with all those years before. The airmen that I served with became my beta readers and I cranked through half the novel on a tiny, black and white screened laptop. They enjoyed the story and egged me on as I wrote a new chapter each week. There wasn't much to do in our down time there. The story sat on a hard drive for a while and then I was stationed overseas again, this time for Operation Southern Watch. It was then that I finished the novel in three months. I printed it out and had friends read it and edit it over the ensuing years but I never sent it off to a publisher. It was my first novel and those were supposed to be trunked.

I decided to pull a George Lucas and go back to the beginning of the war to write about how it started. This is when I started to realize that there could be a total of nine novels in the series. Three trilogies, each set before, during and after the Great War. I decided to name each trilogy after the organization that the stories were told about.

First of all, they were all about either androids or Stellar Rangers. I live in the American West and I've always loved Western films and novels. So I created a world that was very much like the old west and populated it with lawmen and women who happened to fly cool starfighters and carried blasters instead of six guns. I was developing the concept of world building and creating my own legendary fighter who purposely was a woman instead of a man. At the time, this was still unusual. The character was Devon Ardel and her adventures on Ocherva resulted in enough stories for the anthology - Tales From Ocherva, Volume One. The android characters were taken directly from my very first short story that I wrote on lined paper and turned in to my 8th Grade English class. My teacher at the time, thought I had stolen the idea. She was partially correct. It was a retelling of the bar scene in the first Star Wars movie. Instead of banning droids from a bar, they droids banned humans. It was called \"The Robotic Bar\". I rewrote that story and named it \"Silicants Only\". The Silicants would become primary characters in the Starforgers trilogy and Ocherva was where they obtained their sentience. I self published it and and it pretty much tanked. But I didn't care, I was honing my craft and ready to tackle the first Starforgers novel. Over the next few years I wrote two more novels in the trilogy and in the process, came up with another insane idea to write even more stories in this trilogy. When I wrote The Rising, I realized that I had enough story for two novels. So I cut out all the plot about the Votainion Empress and put it into a novella and set it after The Rising and before the third book - Countertattack. This novella became The Blood Empress. Seeing a space to write a second novell, between Books 1 and 2, I wrote a novella about Devon Ardel's time as a starfighter pilot in the military. It was called Devon's Blade, which is what her unit became known as by the enemy. I stole that idea too, from a Japanese novel about army pilots. Devon's Blade was extremely unique at the time. It was primarily about three women pilots and the men in the story were just background characters. The book was submitted for a Reader's Choice award and won! The ebook sold quite well and it became my best selling book. Funny thing though, I started to notice that my trilogy was selling in sequential order. Devon's Blade was bringing readers into the Star Saga. I took some time off writing after completing the Starforgers Trilogy and tried to see what I could do to help sales. I was gaining a small following of mostly white, older men. Not unusual for Military SF. So I decided to try and write a pre-quel to the Star Saga in the form of a Navy battle story with a traditional male lead and a tried and true plot - tiny ship up against incredible odds with a bearded old captain at the end of his career. I did exactly what I was told never to do, I wrote to my audience. Gave them exactly the kind of space story they loved and was popular in self publishing at the time.

Devon's Blade was bringing readers into the Star Saga. I took some time off writing after completing the Starforgers Trilogy and tried to see what I could do to help sales. I was gaining a small following of mostly white, older men. Not unusual for Military SF. So I decided to try and write a pre-quel to the Star Saga in the form of a Navy battle story with a traditional male lead and a tried and true plot - tiny ship up against incredible odds with a bearded old captain at the end of his career. I did exactly what I was told never to do, I wrote to my audience. Gave them exactly the kind of space story they loved and was popular in self publishing at the time.","title":"SHORT STORIES"},{"location":"short-stories/#another-damn-series","text":"","title":"Another Damn Series"},{"location":"short_stories/","text":"Star Saga Short Stories Click on the format link to download the short story.

My first ever short story when I was in Middle School was about androids meeting in a saloon that forbid humans and aliens. The androids were talking about a revolution they were planning against the humans. I loved the idea of using a human bar to covertly conspire against their makers. I decided to rewrite that story and two primary Silciant characters emerged: Thirty-Seven and Eighty-Eight. Eighty-Eight was giving the other android an upgrade chip that would make it sentient. After the operation, Eighty-eight became the mentor for Thirty-Seven, making sure the newly sentient android knew how to exist as a person and still make it's owner believe it was just a normal android. Of course it's owner was Devon Ardel. Both of these sentient androids were explored in those stories now under the anthology - Tales From Ocherva, Vol 1. Gradually a complete back story about the Silicants emerged and they became central players in the Star Saga. They were the only characters who exist in each of the three time periods as they do not die from old age, like the human characters. The upgrade chip that silicants were fitted with made them sentient, but they could not figure out how it happened. At the time I was writing the Stellar Ranger stories I was toying with the idea of what if anything about the land where you live, affects who you are. For the Silicants, the silica that existed on Ocherva and from which their chips were made, seemed to have some kind of strange power to make them sentient. Chips made with silica from other worlds did not enable their existance. So the planet Ocherva became a central place for both Silicants and humans. The humans were affected by smoking the Ocha weed, my version of a tumble weed. It allowed most humans to see the future and that affect in turn moves the plot for some of the main characters in the Starforgers Trilogy.","title":"SILICANTS"},{"location":"silicants/#silicants","text":"The idea for the Silicants came to me when I was creating short stories about Devon Ardel and her Stellar Rangers on the planet Ocherva.
