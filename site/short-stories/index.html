                <h2 id="short-stories">SHORT STORIES</h2>
<p>There emerged two themes in the short stories that I wrote, they were all about either androids or Stellar Rangers. I live in the American West and I've always loved Western films and novels. So I created a world that was very much like the old west and populated it with lawmen and women who happened to fly cool starfighters and carried blasters instead of six guns. I was developing the concept of world building and creating my own legendary fighter who purposely was a woman instead of a man. At the time, this was still unusual. The character was Devon Ardel and her adventures on Ocherva resulted in enough stories for the anthology - Tales From Ocherva, Volume One.</p>
<p>The android characters were taken directly from my very first short story that I wrote on lined paper and turned in to my 8th Grade English class. My teacher at the time, thought I had stolen the idea. She was partially correct. It was a retelling of the bar scene in the first Star Wars movie. Instead of banning droids from a bar, the droids banned humans. It was called, "The Robotic Bar". I rewrote that story and named it "Silicants Only". The Silicants would become primary characters in the Starforgers trilogy and Ocherva was where they obtained their sentience.</p>
<p>I self published it and and it pretty much tanked. But I didn't care, I was honing my craft and ready to tackle the first Starforgers novel. Over the next few years I wrote two more novels in the trilogy and in the process, came up with another insane idea to write even more stories in this trilogy. When I wrote The Rising, I realized that I had enough story for two novels. So I cut out the plot about the Votainion Empress, and put it into a novella and set it after The Rising and before the third book - Countertattack. This novella became The Blood Empress. Seeing a space to write a second novella, between Books 1 and 2, I wrote a story about Devon Ardel's time as a starfighter pilot in the military. It was called Devon's Blade, which is what her unit became known as by the enemy. I stole that idea too, from a Japanese novel about fighter pilots.</p>
<p>Devon's Blade was extremely unique at the time. It was primarily about three women pilots and the men in the story were just background characters. The book was submitted for a Reader's Choice award and won! The ebook sold quite well and it became my best selling book. Funny thing though, I started to notice that my trilogy was selling in sequential order. Devon's Blade was bringing readers into the Star Saga.</p>
<p>I took some time off writing after completing the Starforgers Trilogy and tried to see what I could do to help sales. I was gaining a small following of mostly white, older men. Not unusual for Military SF. So I decided to try and write a prequel to the Star Saga in the form of a naval battle story with a traditional male lead and a tried-and-true plot - a tiny ship up against incredible odds with a bearded old captain at the end of his career. I did exactly what I was told never to do, I wrote to my audience. Gave them exactly the kind of space story they loved and was popular in self publishing at the time.</p>
